/**
 * TODO: 
 * I already add the sms page
 * I need to be able to send the code then receive it at the admin page
 * Then send the client to loading page
 * Then add the good bad button to the admin script panel
 * I need to add a var to the client db, to know the next to send the client
 * If bad we resend the client to the otp page with the error, using the endpoint
 * 
 * FIXME: 
 * I need to fix the details page if accessible yes or not 
 * (we will check after adding the new var to the db client)
